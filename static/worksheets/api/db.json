This is a stick sniper masterpiece where you take on the role of an assassin who has lead a hard life full of cold blood and hot women. It's a dark world when you're an assassin for hire and even though he may be the best there is at what he does, that doesn't mean what he does is very nice! Use basic sniper mechanics to delve into the questionable past of this hitman as you rack up a kill count and blast your way through his story. This is a story based stick sniper shooter which brings the duo-tone world of hyper-violent stick games to life through its deep characterization, and complex storytelling. You'll be introduced to characters you might not like but you will definitely understand. You will be forced to question your own morals and ethics as you stare down the barrel of a gun and into the yawning chasm of imperfect humans. Stick games are a staple of the casual gaming industry. They have been around longer than any of us and will probably be around a lot longer than any of us. Clear Vision is a step above the rest. It is truly one of the greatest stick sniper games available.",

You'll have to click through lists, and go through different rooms and get all wrapped up in a plot line but at the end of all that after you bought your ammo and checked a name off a list and cleaned your kitchen or whatever: You will finally get to do some sniping! And it is worth it. The physics, the puzzles, the stick men, the aiming. It all comes together with your choice of guns and ammo to create a truly immersive sniper experience. Is it revenge, are you trying to save the world? Are you doing it just for the money? Only those who read through the multiple screens at the beginning of the game will know for sure. This is an exciting sniper adventure where you take on the underground gangs of the world and dish out justice from behind the business end of a smoking gun. Ready, aim, fun!",

This is a casual time-management game so you'll have to upgrade and then wait and see if your disease is progressing before your time limit. As time passes, you'll gain evolution points which is what you can use to purchase upgrades.",
